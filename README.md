# phplinuxtrack
PHPlinuxTrack is a simple PHP torrent display mechanism designed to ease and beautify the managing the torrent files of a linux distro or other software project. It was created by John Cave of the OpenMandriva project.

Basically, PHPlinuxTrack makes a pretty display of the seeders, downloaders and total transfers of your torrent files. It does this using Bootstrap as the frontend.

The requirements are:
 - phpredis
 - redis
 - (in future, memcache may be supported as an alternative to Redis)
 - PHP5
